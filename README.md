# ASR-Game
This is a template to build games with online speech recognition for brazilian portuguese. This project is responsable for the client side request and can recognize the ordinal numbers from 0 to 9. The custom server side with CNN-BLSTM will be available soon and my research team will teach how to build (all parameters to collect and train) your own grammar.
